# Flashcard Game

## Purpose:

When I was a kid, my dad found a fun way to teach me multiplication tables using index cards. It was a simple flashcard game, and I loved it! Today, being a software developer and a mother, I was able to do the same for my son, but instead of using index cards, I made it more up to date. And why not use this same methodology to learn more things, right? So, in this flashcard game you will find subjects such as multiplication, division, addition, subtraction and Java Script! Have fun!

## User Stories:

- As a player, I want to click on one(1) of the six(6) index cards that contains different answers to check if my answer is correct.
- As a player, I want to get as many correct answers as possible.
